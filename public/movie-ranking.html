<h1>The Best Movies According to Favour</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Game of thrones</h3>
<p>I love this movie so much because it doesn't miss out on any aspect of pure entertainment and thrills</p>
<h3>House of the Dragon</h3>
<p>From the makers of the previous movie, HBO. This movie captures the thrill and according to the context of the movie, it is exactly 185 years before the birth of a very significant character-Daenerys Targaryen.</p>
<h3>Fast and Furious</h3>
<p>Leaves me off the edge of my seat with their draw-droppig action</p>
